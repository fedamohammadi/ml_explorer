> **Run it locally in one click** → double-click `run.bat`  
> **Or in your terminal:**
> ```bash
> # from the repo root
> .venv\Scripts\streamlit run app.py

## Overview

ML Explorer is a self-contained learning tool that covers the full breadth of applied machine learning — from probability distributions and regression mathematics to ensemble methods and model evaluation. Every concept is paired with an **interactive demo** where you control the parameters and see results instantly.

It is designed to be used alongside the `Fundamentals of Python` learning repository as a practical companion to the econometrics and data analysis scripts.

## Pages

### 🏠 Home
- What is Machine Learning? — taxonomy and key concepts
- Glossary of core terms (features, overfitting, gradient descent, cross-validation, …)
- Quick-navigation overview of all topics

### 📊 Supervised Learning
Five fully interactive tabs:

| Tab | What you can do |
|-----|----------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Adjust slope, noise, sample size. Toggle residual lines. Live R² and RMSE. |
| **Logistic Regression** | Control class separation and regularisation C. Live decision boundary contour. |
| **Decision Tree** | Tune depth and criterion (Gini / Entropy). Visualise decision regions. |
| **Random Forest** | Set number of trees, depth, feature fraction. Compare against a single tree. |
| **KNN & SVM** | Switch between algorithms. Tune K, kernel, C, gamma. Side-by-side decision boundary. |

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning
Three tabs:

| Tab | What you can do |
|-----|----------------|
| **K-Means** | Choose K, spread, and sample size. Voronoi regions + elbow chart to select optimal K. |
| **PCA** | Control features and components. Scree plot with cumulative variance. 2D projection scatter. |
| **DBSCAN** | Pick dataset shape (Moons / Circles / Blobs). Tune ε and min_samples. Noise points highlighted. |

### 📈 Probability & Regression
Three tabs:

| Tab | What you can do |
|-----|----------------|
| **Distributions** | Explore Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Exponential, and Uniform. Full parameter control + optional CDF overlay. |
| **Regression Types** | Compare OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and Polynomial on the same noisy data. Tune α, polynomial degree, noise. |
| **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** | Adjust polynomial degree and watch bias² vs variance change across bootstrap samples. Live decomposition chart. |

### 🎮 Model Playground
A full end-to-end training environment:

- **5 datasets** — Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer, Synthetic Classification, Synthetic Regression
- **9 models** — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Ridge, Lasso
- **Full hyperparameter control** from the sidebar
- **Evaluation outputs** — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Cross-validation score, Confusion Matrix, ROC / AUC curve, Feature Importance / Coefficients
- **Dataset preview** table

---

## Features

- **Fully reactive** — every chart updates instantly as you move a slider or change a setting
- **Dark theme** with a purple/cyan/amber colour palette
- **Multi-page navigation** via Streamlit's built-in sidebar
- **No training step needed** — models retrain automatically on every interaction
- **Educational cards** on every page explaining the intuition behind each algorithm
- **Zero configuration** — just install dependencies and run

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ and a virtual environment set up at the repo root.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fedamohammadi/ml_explorer.git
cd Fundementals-of-Python

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r projects/ml_explorer/requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the App

**Option 1 — One click (Windows)**

Double-click `projects/ml_explorer/run.bat`

**Option 2 — Terminal**

```bash
# From the repo root
.venv\Scripts\streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Deploy to the Cloud

You can host ML Explorer for free on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) so anyone can access it via a permanent public URL — no local setup required.

**Steps:**

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **"New app"**
3. Set the following:

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | Repository | `fedamohammadi/ml_explorer` |
   | Branch | `main` |
   | Main file path | `app.py` |

4. Click **"Deploy"** — your permanent public URL will be ready in ~2 minutes

Once deployed, the badge at the top of this README will link directly to your live app.
